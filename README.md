## Overview
This project leverages the Transformer architecture to enhance sentiment analysis of Twitter comments. By effectively capturing long-range dependencies and intricate semantic nuances, the model delivers improved performance in understanding and classifying sentiments in text data.

## Features
* Preprocessing of Twitter comments for sentiment analysis.
* Implementation of a Transformer-based model.
* Fine-tuning on a sentiment analysis dataset.
* Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Visualization of results with sentiment distribution and model performance metrics.

## Motivation
Twitter data is often characterized by its brevity, noise, and rich semantic structure. Traditional sentiment analysis techniques struggle with such complexities. By utilizing the power of Transformers, this project addresses these challenges and delivers more nuanced sentiment classification.

## Dataset
* The project uses a publicly available Twitter dataset.
* The dataset contains labeled tweets with sentiments: positive, negative, and neutral.
* If you use a different dataset, ensure proper preprocessing steps for compatibility with the Transformer model.

## Architecture
* The project utilizes a Transformer-based model.
* Tokenization with Hugging Face's Tokenizer.
* Embedding and positional encoding using pre-trained weights.
* Output layer adjusted for sentiment classification.

  
## Requirements
* Python 3.7+
* PyTorch 1.9+
* Hugging Face Transformers 4.0+
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
